Here you can find information and few popular algorithms as implemented with graphs pathfinding (BFS DFS), graph structure, and trees as well as it particular case of graph structure. Great public video link with graphs theory find here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09_LlHjoEiY&amp;list=PLwL98BYbnmsrYIiqbqnZQJD2yxNtCzLLF).
